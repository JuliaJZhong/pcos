components (0-indexed) i have further analyzed:
- 9: highest Pf2 weight
- 16: highest weight in logistic regression w/ LASSO CV
- 21: high predictive power in paired un-penalized logistic regression
- 24: second highest weight in logistic regression w/ LASSO CV and high predictive power in paired un-penalized logistic regression
- 26: seems to have weighted projections capturing variance in 721 B lymphoblast cluster
